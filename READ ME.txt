ESP32 Schematic Note: CP2102N-A01-GQFN28 Unconnected Pins:

Issue Description:
This repository contains an ESP32 schematic that follows Espressif's reference design. A common "issue" appears with the CP2102N-A01-GQFN28 USB-to-UART bridge IC where several pins show warnings for "Label not connected to anything".


Affected Pins:

The following pins on the CP2102N-A01-GQFN28 are intentionally left unconnected:
- CTS (Clear To Send)
- DSR (Data Set Ready)
- DCD (Data Carrier Detect)
- RI (Ring Indicator)


Important Note:
This is not a design error or schematic bug. This is the correct and intended configuration as specified in Espressif's official ESP32 reference designs.


Recommended Action:
- Ignore schematic warnings/errors about these unconnected pins
- Do not attempt to "fix" these connections
- The design will function perfectly despite these warnings


Verification:

You can verify this is correct by checking:
- Espressif's official ESP32 development board schematics (DevKitC, etc.)
- CP2102N datasheet application notes
- Successful operation of USB-to-serial communication


Design Files:
This schematic follows industry-standard practices for ESP32 designs. The unconnected pins are a conscious design decision to simplify the circuit while maintaining full functionality for typical use cases.
